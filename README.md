# Sudo Virtual Cards Simulator iOS SDK

## Overview
Credit cards have long been a powerful way for retailers (and banks) to track not only users but their spending habits. This data is often used and even sold without users knowing and what consequences it may later bring.

That is why we offer virtual credit cards for your users. They will be able to shop securely, keep track of all their transactions, and dynamically create cards for every purpose. Users can create virtual cards whenever they need to. They can make purchases with the peace of mind that their personal details are going to stay private.

This SDK can be used to simulate transactional data in a sandbox environment.

Please see the [Sudo Platform Developer Docs](https://sudoplatform.com/docs) for an overview of Virtual Cards in the Sudo Platform.
